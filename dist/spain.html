                <h2>Spain</h2>
                <p>Once a great global empire, an incredible colonial power, Spain stood strong among many countries
                    and ruled territories in many parts of the world throughout history. However, Spain's might of the
                    olden days is now transformed into a country with an unhurried, relaxed environment. A place that
                    is ever welcoming to travelers from all over the world. Although known for its great sandy beaches,
                    Spain is waiting to be discovered more, from its ice-capped mountains, green lands, arid zones,
                    historical cities' narrow streets, and grand display of art and architecture.</p>
                <p>Good times will surely be experienced with Pamplona's thronged “Running with the Bulls” or during a
                    famous Spaniard's flamenco guitar performance on the side many streets. As a country dominated by
                    Roman Catholics, fiesta celebrations are often anywhere in the country with many merrymaking
                    activities to enjoy. Not to forget, the country offers travelers a variety of great cuisines full
                    of aroma and mouth savoring tastes too.</p>

                <h2>Geographic and Demographics</h2>
                <img src="assets/spn/spn1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Iberians were the first people to settle in Spain who were later colonized by the Greeks and
                    Carthaginians. In the 3rd century BC, the Romans ruled. The word Spain originated from the Roman
                    name "Hispania". Spain is the second largest country in Europe, next to France, which is located in
                    an area known as the Iberian Peninsula. This island is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the
                    south to the east, Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Bay of Biscay to the north. Spain is also
                    bounded by the lands of Portugal, France, Andorra, Morocco, and Gibraltar.</p>
                <h2>People and Culture</h2>
                <img src="assets/spn/spn2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The people of Spain are mostly born and raised as Roman Catholic. Spanish people give high value to
                    religion since Catholicism has been a great influence to their culture. Compared to other European
                    countries, Spanish lifestyle is more relaxed. They observe siesta or afternoon naps giving them
                    more time to spend with their families. Spanish people are also traditional. The people of Spain
                    love festivities and any kind of celebrations. A number of fiestas are observed all throughout the
                    year, during which the locals dress up in traditional costumes and celebrate until dawn, with
                    sangria, wine, beer, and traditional Spanish food.</p>
